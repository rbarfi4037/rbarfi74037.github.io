			<p>	There are 2 different types of MP4 formats, MP4(H.264) and MP4(H.265). Here we have H.264 on the left and H.265 on the right. As you can see, the H.265 file,
			cannot be displayed on this website, but the audio is present. This is becasue the computer has not made the format H.265 compatible with most websites. The H.264
			format is compatible, and common in most devices. However, it is not the most efficient way to broadcast a video. It takes up twice the file size of H.265. H.265 
			is a smaller size, has a higher video quality, and uses a lower bit rate. This is due to the different ways the computer stores the pixels' colors. H.264 stores 
			colors that transition to the next part, and compress the colors that stay the same. H.265 uses a more efficient method by compressing certain parts into a smaller 
			file size. The problem is the computers cannot load the H.265 format quick enough to use. Computers that CAN use H.265 prefer the format for streaming on things like Netflix 
			or YouTube, but for smaller size videos like these, they would load too slow to watch. Modern software companies are attempting to create more common computers like 
			a smartphone to have the compatiblity to use H.265. Compressing videos over and over again to save storage space in the H.264 format would cause the quality of the 
			video to go down and get blurrier each time. H.265, makes the compression better for the viewer.</p>
